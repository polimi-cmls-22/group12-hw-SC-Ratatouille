WOODY is an FM synth, which receives the input signal from a MIDI keyboard.
Due to its FM nature, WOODY exploits the combined action of carriers and modulators, organized into different algorithms. 
WOODY has four operators and eight algorithms, which allow the creation of a discrete variety of sounds. The user can select the algorithm and modify output and frequency levels of each operator. As regards envelopes trends, they can be drawn by the user. WOODY also offers the possibility to create sound effects thanks to the LFO. It can be applied both to the amplitude and pitch of the final output.
Other modifiable parameters are the master volume and the total duration of the sound.
